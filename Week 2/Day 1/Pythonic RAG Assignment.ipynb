      "A Materialized View is a pre-aggregated or pre-filtered data set that is created in advance and stored in a database to improve query performance. It shifts the computational load from query time to ingestion time, allowing endpoints to remain fast by reducing the query speed and scan size. Materialized Views are typically used when a simple query is taking too much time, the same aggregations are used in multiple pipes, a query is processing too much data, or when there is a need to change the data schema for a new use case.\n"
